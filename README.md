### Guillaume Desfoges, Théo Viel

## Introduction 

### About this project

This project is a school project at the ENPC IMI Mathematics and Computer Sciences department.
It was done by Guillaume Desforges and Théo Viel, with the supervision of Mathieu Aubry.
The main repository for this project is : https://github.com/GuillaumeDesforges/ocr-enpc

### Objectives

Our objective is to devellop an easy to use API for Optical Character Recognition.
Theoritically, this repository is meant to be a "*base for future OCR development*" rather than an example.

### Main library used :
* Keras for the neural networks.
* Tensorflow as backend.
* Pyqt for the API.
